# Oponn looks far ahead into the future. Occasionally he gets lost in the myriad possibilities.
# Tune his strength by adjusting the number of iterations. The more iterations the stronger he 
# he plays but will take longer per move. The suggested range is somewhere between 1000-10000.
# If you happen to be running Lux on a super computer you can get away with much higher values.

# Number of cores. Set as 'n' to fully utilise the number of cores on your machine.

# See into Oponn's mind by turning debug on.
